## Story

All coins are equal in my eyes, just like all marine creatures need to wait for my judgment!

That’s right, I’m a sheriff – a sea hare.

Any two coins can be compared together, the only criterion is your choice. If you like it, vote. For three days, the loser will be branded with shame by me.

What? You ask what to do if someone messes up?

- I can spray purple ink to form a detection barrier or even poison the enemy.
- My unique photosynthesis and powerful regeneration ability can support a protracted battle.
- Mine...

Okay, okay, no matter how powerful I am as a sea hare, there will inevitably be some fish that slip through the net.

But I still have the most powerful killer move.

That’s you!

You are the unstoppable sword of sea hare.

You offer your vote only to continue the hope for the meme market.

Some of you are here to change the world.

Some of you are here to explore the mysteries of memes.

Some of you are here for the ones you love.

Some of you are here to fulfill your own meaning...

We will fight side by side to restore the reputation of Memecoin!

Tomorrow comes

Thanks to you
